/*
This class should follow a line using three sensors. 

You may add types, values, functions and operations as necessary in 
your solution.

Sensors are accessed through sensor objects (sensor1, sensor2) 
of the type BlackWhiteSensor, with the following operations:

IsBlack: () ==> bool -- true if sensor1 sees black, false otherwise 
IsWhite: () ==> bool -- true if sensor sees white, false otherwise
Scale: () ==> real   -- raw sensor reading: 0.0 = black, 1.0 = white
GetSensor().HasFailed() ==> bool -- true if the sensor has failed

Robot movement is accessed through various operations (from the 
AbstractController super class):

Forward(x); -- move forward, range (0, 1.0)
Reverse(x); -- move backward, range (0, 1.0)
Turn(x,y);  -- set left and right wheel speed, range (-1,1)
Stop();     -- stop the robot

*/
class Controller2S is subclass of AbstractController

instance variables

private sensor1: BlackWhiteSensor := new BlackWhiteSensor(); -- "red" sensor
private sensor2: BlackWhiteSensor := new BlackWhiteSensor(); -- "blue" sensor

operations

-- initialise mode with context
public Init: () ==> ()
Init() == (
    -- set instance variables
	sensor1 := GetBW(1);
	sensor2 := GetBW(2);
		
);

-- control loop
public Loop: () ==> ()
Loop() == (
	Forward(1);
);
